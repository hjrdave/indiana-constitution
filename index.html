<span style="font-weight: 400;">(A) In the event of a veto while the General Assembly is in session, he shall return
    such bill, with his objections, within seven days of presentment, to the House in which it originated. If the
    Governor does not return the bill within seven days of presentment, the bill becomes a law notwithstanding the
    veto. </span>

    originated shall enter the Governor's objections at large upon its journals and proceed to reconsider and vote upon
    whether to approve the bill. The bill must be reconsidered and voted upon within the time set out in clause (C). If,
    after such reconsideration and vote, a majority of all the members elected to that House shall approve the bill, it
    shall be sent, with the Governor's objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered and
    voted upon, and, if approved by a majority of all the members elected to that House, it shall be a law. </span>

    reconsider and vote upon the approval of the bill before the final adjournment of the</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">next regular session of the General Assembly that follows the regular or special session
    in which the bill was originally passed. If the House in which the bill originated does not approve the bill under
    clause (B), the other House is not required to reconsider and vote upon the approval of the bill. If, after voting,
    either House fails to approve the bill within this time, the veto is sustained. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(D) In the event of a veto after final adjournment of a session of the General Assembly,
    such bill shall be returned by the Governor to the House in which it originated on the first day that the General
    Assembly is in session after such adjournment, which House shall proceed in the same manner as with a bill vetoed
    before adjournment. The bill must be reconsidered and voted upon within the time set out in clause (C). If such bill
    is not so returned, it shall be a law notwithstanding such veto. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(3) He may refuse to sign or veto such bill in which event it shall become a law without
    his signature on the eighth day after presentment to the Governor. </span>

    act within said seven days after presentment shall be filed with the Secretary of State within ten days of
    presentment. The failure to so file shall not prevent such a bill from becoming a law. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) In the event a bill is passed over the Governor's veto, such bill shall be filed
    with the Secretary of State without further presentment to the Governor, provided that, in the event of such passage
    over the Governor's veto in the next succeeding General Assembly, the passage shall be deemed to have been the
    action of the General Assembly which initially passed such bill. </span>
